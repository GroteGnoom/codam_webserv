use hostname - maybe check this by putting two servers on the same port with different hostnames -- no, using the same port multiple times should not work
the default error page needs to be able to be set in the configuration
-- for exapmle with:   error_page 404 403 500 503 /error-page.html;

send a big file:
	check boundary correctly?
	use file name given by user
	CGI GET uses a query string, but
	CGI POST passes its information via standard input (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3557831/how-to-use-stdin-on-perl-cgi)
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/464040/how-are-post-and-get-variables-handled-in-python
	
the subject mentions default servers: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html

limit client body size in configuration
-- then do post requests smaller or larger than body limit. 

test configuration with muliple routes

define list of accepted methods for route

turn directory listing on and off
-- if client does a request on a location, and there is no index.html (or other root file) then a script should be called to show all the files. Can also just be a function that outputs html.

test unknown requests, like not GET OR POST, but SOMETHINGRANDOM
